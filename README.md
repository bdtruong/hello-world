Introduction to GitHub


Hello GitHub

I'm a secondary ed teacher that hated my job, sold all my shit and moved to Vietnam for year. It was awesome. Now I'm broke and trying to learn coding and programming to work remotely so I can continue to travel the world and avoid the real world for as long as possible.

Cheers!
